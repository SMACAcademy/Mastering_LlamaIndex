Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regardingthe potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking\\nstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantlyfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\\nItem 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months orperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the“Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and thecondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate\\ngovernance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumersand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nQuarterly Highlights\\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022.\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro, both powered by the new\\nApple M2 chip. The Company also announced iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be\\navailable in the fall of 2022.\\nThe Company repurchased $21.7 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the third quarter of 2022.\\n® ®\\n® ® ®\\nApple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 14', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private\\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based oncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regardingthe potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking\\nstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly\\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months orperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is notincorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\\nevery five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023.

Legal Proceedings\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc.

TheCompany filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect tonine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern\\nCalifornia District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued aninjunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.

General. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these “Terms”) apply to a particular restricted stock unit\\naward (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant\\n(the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the\\n“Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted\\nunder and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms\\nare defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of,\\nany other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to\\nas the “Award Agreement” applicable to the Award.\\n2.    RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the\\ndetermination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall not\\nbe treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\\n3.    Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each\\nvesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date.”) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional\\nShares in settlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and vest when such combined\\nfractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried forward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next\\nsubsequent Vesting Date shall be forfeited.\\n4.    Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\\nactive employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and\\nthe rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Vesting Commencement\\nDate and the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any\\nproportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of\\nabsence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as\\napproved by the Company, in its sole discretion.

No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\\nstock as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\\n(b)    Dividend Equivalent Rights Distributions.

Limitation on the Participant’s Rights. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This\\nAward Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as\\ncreating a trust.

General. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award - Performance Award (these “Terms”) apply to a particular\\nrestricted stock unit award (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in\\nthe Notice of Grant (the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is\\nreferred to as the “Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The\\nAward was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the\\n“Plan”). Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in\\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these\\nTerms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement” applicable to the\\nAward.\\n2.    RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device\\nfor the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs\\nshall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\\n3.    Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and\\nExhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date”).\\n4.    Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\\nactive employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award\\nAgreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any\\nproportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of\\nabsence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as\\napproved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal\\nleave of absence.\\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the\\nParticipant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain\\nemployed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to\\nterminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other\\ncompensation or benefits.

Dividend and Voting Rights.\\n(a)    Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\\nbook entry evidencing such Shares.\\n(b)    Dividend Equivalent Rights Distributions. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its\\nShares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its\\nShares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan)\\nsubject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”).

For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend\\nEquivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total target number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving\\neffect to Exhibit A. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which,\\nimmediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit\\nA.\\n6.    Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any\\ninterest therein or amount or Shares payable in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,\\nalienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\\n7.    Timing and Manner of Payment of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following the Vesting Date pursuant to\\nSection 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the\\nParticipant a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, as\\ndetermined by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest (or, in the case of the Participant’s\\nRetirement, death or Disability, are treated as vesting) on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related Items, unless such RSUs terminate prior to the\\nVesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested RSUs is\\nsubject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested\\nRSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The\\nParticipant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.\\n8.    Effect of Termination of Service.\\n(a)    Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend\\nEquivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Termination of Service, meaning\\nthe first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Severance Date”),\\nregardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the\\nParticipant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date.\\n2', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based oncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding\\nthe potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.  Forward-lookingstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly\\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months orperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of productintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regardingthe potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.  Forward-lookingstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”\\n“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantlyfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”\\nThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or\\nperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the“Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the\\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governancematters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not\\nincorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of productintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumersand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarterevery five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years\\n2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\\nQuarterly Highlights\\nWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company’s total net sales, which decreased 1% or $1.2 billion during\\nthe third quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022.

Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal\\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of July 1, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to bedisclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\\nspecified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer andprincipal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection withmanagement’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\\nto materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\\nApple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 19', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Legal Proceedings\\nEpic Games\\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company allegingviolations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10,2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain\\nprovisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company fromprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “CircuitCourt”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision.On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction\\npending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Epic has appealed the Circuit Court’s stay of the injunction. If the U.S. Supreme Court reverses the Circuit Court’sstay of the injunction or declines Apple’s petition, the injunction will take effect.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. TheCompany settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial\\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reportingperiod for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materiallyadversely affected.\\nItem 1A.    Risk Factors\\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known\\nor unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risksmaterialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adverselyaffected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K.\\nApple Inc. | Q3 2023 Form 10-Q | 20', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
