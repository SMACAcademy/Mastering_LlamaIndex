Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regardingthe potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking\\nstatements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantlyfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\\nItem 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months orperiods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the“Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and thecondensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate\\ngovernance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumersand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nQuarterly Highlights\\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022.\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro, both powered by the new\\nApple M2 chip. The Company also announced iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be\\navailable in the fall of 2022.\\nThe Company repurchased $21.7 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the third quarter of 2022.\\n® ®\\n® ® ®\\nApple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 14', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4521, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
