      "Questions this excerpt can answer: \n",
      "Based on the provided context, here are three potential questions with specific answers that are unlikely to be found elsewhere:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. What is the primary purpose of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and how does it relate to the certification statement made by Timothy D. Cook as CEO of Apple Inc.?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The primary purpose of Section 404 is to ensure the accuracy and completeness of a company's financial reporting, particularly with regards to internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). The certification statement made by Timothy D. Cook confirms that the quarterly report on Form 10-Q accurately presents the company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. What is the significance of the phrase \"material information relating to the Registrant\" in the context of Section 404, and how does it relate to the design of disclosure controls and procedures?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The phrase \"material information relating to the Registrant\" refers to information that could influence the decisions of investors or other stakeholders. In the context of Section 404, this means that disclosure controls and procedures must be designed to ensure that material information is made known to management, particularly during the period in which the report is being prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. How do the requirements of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) relate to the design of internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), and what are the implications for a company's certifying officers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) require companies to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as well as ICFR. The rules specify that certifying officers must design or cause to be designed these systems under their supervision, with the goal of providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Higher-level summaries of surrounding context:\n",

      "\n",
      "3. What is the significance of the fourth fiscal quarter (the Registrant's fourth fiscal quarter) for the purpose of disclosing changes in internal control over financial reporting?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The fourth fiscal quarter is the most recent fiscal quarter, and any change in internal control that occurred during this period must be disclosed if it has a material effect on the company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial information.\n",

      "2. What specific requirements does the certification statement imply for publicly traded companies like Apple Inc. regarding their internal control over financial reporting?\n",
