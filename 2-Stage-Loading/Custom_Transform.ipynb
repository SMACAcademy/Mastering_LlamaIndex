      "Cleaned Text: But painting was postrigorous Painting students were supposed to express themselves which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature styleA signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a schtick something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one elses For example when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon you know its by Roy Lichtenstein So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager you know he paid millions of dollars for it Thats not always why artists have a signature style but its usually why buyers pay a lot for such work 6There were plenty of earnest students too kids who could draw in high school and now had come to what was supposed to be the best art school in the country to learn to draw even better They tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD but they kept going because painting was what they did I was not one of the kids who could draw in high school but at RISD I was definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style seekersI learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD but otherwise I was basically teaching myself to paint and I could do that for free So in 1993 I dropped out I hung around Providence for a bit and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor A rentcontrolled apartment in a building her mother owned in New York was becoming vacant Did I want it It wasnt much more than my current place and New York was supposed to be where the artists were So yes I wanted it 7Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans You can do something similar on a map of New York City if you zoom in on the Upper East Side theres a tiny corner thats not rich or at least wasnt in 1993 Its called Yorkville and that was my new home\n",
